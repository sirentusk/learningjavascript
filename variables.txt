// Variables

A variable is a container.

var = can be used globally
let/const = can only be used within the same block
let = can be changed
const = cannot be changed once made

const = constant, can't change
let = can change
let <variablename> = "";
const <variablename> = "";
<variable name> = <variable name> <operator> <value>;
one = one + 1;

concatenation = "some" + "thing"

â€‹let one = 1'
one + 1;
